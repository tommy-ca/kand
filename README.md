## Why Kand?

`Kand` is engineered as a modern replacement for `TA-Lib`, addressing its core limitations—such as single-threaded execution, Python GIL constraints, memory overhead, and inefficient real-time processing—while preserving its strengths in comprehensive indicator support and ease of integration. Built in Rust, `Kand` delivers superior performance, safety, and flexibility for quantitative trading, data science, and financial analysis.

- **⚡ Superior Performance with Memory Safety**
  Leveraging Rust's efficiency, `Kand` achieves speeds rivaling or exceeding `TA-Lib`'s peak performance, but with built-in memory safety that eliminates common vulnerabilities and reduces overhead in `TA-Lib`'s C-based implementation.

- **🔓 True Multithreading Capabilities**
  Unlike `TA-Lib`, which is hindered by Python's GIL and single-threaded design, `Kand` enables seamless parallel processing across multiple cores, unlocking significant gains in multi-threaded environments for large-scale computations.

- **⚙️ Efficient Real-Time Incremental Updates**
  `Kand` introduces O(1) complexity for incremental calculations, ideal for streaming data and real-time applications—overcoming `TA-Lib`'s reliance on batch processing, which introduces latency and inefficiency in dynamic scenarios.

- **🚀 Zero-Copy NumPy Integration**
  With native, zero-copy data sharing via Rust-NumPy bindings, `Kand` ensures lossless, high-speed data flow between Python and Rust, addressing `TA-Lib`'s memory copying overhead and enabling ultra-low latency (~7ns) operations.

- **📊 Expanded Indicator Suite**
  Kand supports a wide array of standard indicators (e.g., EMA, RSI, MACD) like ``TA-Lib``, while pioneering advanced ones such as Vegas, VWAP, and Supertrend, extending analytical capabilities beyond `TA-Lib`'s traditional scope.

- **📦 Streamlined Installation and Lightweight Design**
  Install with a single `pip install kand` command, featuring precompiled wheels and no complex C dependencies—solving `TA-Lib`'s notoriously cumbersome setup and reducing package bloat for effortless deployment.

- **💻 Broad Cross-Platform Compatibility**
  Seamlessly runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows, with additional support for JavaScript/TypeScript via `WebAssembly`, providing greater universality than `TA-Lib`'s platform-specific challenges.

> *If you truly understand `TA-Lib`'s limitations, you'll appreciate Kand's innovations.* `Kand` isn't just about fixing what's broken—it's about enabling what's possible. Dive deeper at [**why `kand`**](https://kand-ta.github.io/kand/about).

### Python API

The Python interface of `kand` leverages PyO3 for ultra-low latency bindings to the Rust core, seamlessly integrating with NumPy for zero-copy operations and true thread-safe calculations. Below are examples for batch and incremental usage.

```python
import numpy as np
from kand import ema

# Batch EMA computation with zero-copy NumPy integration
prices = np.array([10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0], dtype=np.float64)
ema_values = ema(prices, period=3)

# Incremental EMA update for streaming data
prev_ema = 13.5
new_price = 15.0
new_ema = ema_inc(new_price, prev_ema, period=3)
```

**Key Features:**

- **Zero-Copy Performance**: Optimized data transfer between Rust, Python, and WebAssembly.
- **Apache Arrow Native**: First-class support for Arrow arrays, enabling zero-copy interoperability with Polars, PyArrow, and modern data stacks.
- **High Performance**: Native Rust implementation, releasing GIL in Python and providing optimized WASM views for JavaScript.

### Examples

| Language | Topic | Link |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Rust** | Native Arrow Usage | [`kand/examples/arrow_sma.rs`](./kand/examples/arrow_sma.rs) |
| **Python** | Polars Zero-Copy Interop | [`kand-py/python/examples/polars_interop.py`](./kand-py/python/examples/polars_interop.py) |
| **WASM** | Shared Memory Protocol | [`kand-wasm/README.md`](./kand-wasm/README.md) |

### Rust API

The Rust interface in `kand` provides a high-performance, type-safe implementation of EMA with flexible parameter control. It supports both Vec and ndarray inputs for batch and incremental calculations, as shown below.

```rust
use kand::ohlcv::ema;
use ndarray::Array1;

// Batch EMA calculation over a price series
let prices = vec![10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0];
let mut ema_values = vec![0.0; prices.len()];
ema::ema(&prices, 3, None, &mut ema_values)?;

// Batch EMA with ndarray for scientific workflows
let prices = Array1::from_vec(vec![10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0]);
let mut ema_values = Array1::zeros(prices.len());
ema::ema(&prices, 3, None, &mut ema_values)?;

// Constant-time incremental EMA update
let prev_ema = 13.5;
let new_price = 15.0;
let new_ema = ema::ema_inc(new_price, prev_ema, 3, None)?;
```

**Key Features:**

- **Memory Efficiency**: Leverages mutable buffers (`&mut Vec<f64>` or `&mut Array1<f64>`) to store results, slashing memory allocations.
- **Error Handling**: Returns `Result<(), KandError>` or `Result<f64, KandError>` for reliable failure detection (e.g., invalid period, NaN inputs).
- **Incremental Design**: O(1) updates tailored for real-time systems.

### JavaScript/TypeScript API

The JavaScript/TypeScript interface provides WebAssembly bindings for high-performance technical analysis in web applications and Node.js projects. It delivers near-native performance with a clean, synchronous API.

```typescript
import { ema, emaInc } from 'kand';

// Batch EMA computation for price series
const prices = new Float64Array([10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0]);
const emaValues = ema(prices, 3, null);
console.log(emaValues);

// Incremental EMA update for streaming data
const prevEma = 13.5;
const newPrice = 15.0;
const newEma = emaInc(newPrice, prevEma, 3, null);
console.log(newEma);

// Custom smoothing factor
const customK = 0.5;
const customEma = emaInc(newPrice, prevEma, 3, customK);
```

**Key Features:**

- **WebAssembly Performance**: Near-native speed through optimized WASM bindings.
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript definitions with comprehensive JSDoc documentation.
- **ES Module Standard**: Adheres to the ES module standard for native integration with modern JavaScript environments.
